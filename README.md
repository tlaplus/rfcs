# Request for Comments for TLA+

Request for Comments (RFCs) for changes to TLA+.
This includes the language, its libraries, tools, and the project itself.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow in the tool-specific repositories.
Other changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the TLA+ community.
The RFC process is intended to provide a *consistent and controlled path* for new features to enter the *language*, *standard libraries*, and *tools*, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction the TLA+ project is evolving in.

To get a proposal started, please [familiarize yourself with our RFC process](https://github.com/tlaplus/rfcs/issues/21) then [open an issue](https://github.com/tlaplus/rfcs/issues).

## Repository Contents

This repository is organized as follows:
- [accepted_rfcs](accepted_rfcs): each accepted RFC should have a directory here containing relevant material along with a document tracking adoption of the RFC by the tools.
- [language_standard](language_standard): standards documents and test suites for consultation by those implementing TLA‚Å∫ language tooling.
