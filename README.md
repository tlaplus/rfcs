# Request for Comments for TLA+
Request for Comments (RFCs) for changes to the TLA+ specification language

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Other changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the TLA+ community.

The RFC process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the language and standard libraries, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction the language is evolving in.


To get an RFC started, [please open an issue](https://github.com/tlaplus/rfcs/issues).
