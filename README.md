# Request for Comments for TLA+
Request for Comments (RFCs) for changes to the TLA+ specification language.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow in the tool-specific repositories.

Other changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the TLA+ community.

The RFC process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features to enter the language, standard libraries, and tools, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction the TLA+ project is evolving in.


To get an RFC started, [please open an issue](https://github.com/tlaplus/rfcs/issues).
